=============

The SaS revenue model, based on recurrent revenue and sales expansion, is a simple, intuitive and powerful model and an ally for young startups. It provides clear KPIs for growth and forces you to concentrate on what matters: sustainable exponential growth.

However computing the actual KPIs of your business, and generally keeping track of what really matters can be hard. 
You'll need to do a LOT of NASTY Excel before obtaining those KIPs, and you'll leave in fear of error. Examples of things that get messy:
- sorting thru the different payment and billing schemes
- keeping track of new and cancelled contracts, as well as changes in the existing ones, 
- dealing with different starting and ending contract times
- dealing with projects of fixed duration with set-up fees
- and a few other nasty things that will burn your late night hours...

After fighting with excel for a year or so I ended up developing a simple Java library to compute the things I need to know every month:
- reports of contract changes, new contracts, etc.
- Monthly SaS KPIs

I hope this library can be of help for other geeks out there trying to keep control of their companies exponential growth ;)
